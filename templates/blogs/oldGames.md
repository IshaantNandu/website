# Ishaant's old games

I Love "Making" video games, though my parents never let me play any of them. See, my parents were really concerned about me getting addicted to them _(Thanks a lot, mamma,pappa)_, so I never really played them, but that didn't stop me from getting the joy of making them. Of course, [Unity](https://unity.com) or any other game-making framework was hard for 6-year-old me to make, and I JUST Hated how difficult was it to make a game in [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) (not so difficult, really), so I found ðŸ˜‡[Makecode Arcade](http://arcade.makecode.com)ðŸ˜‡ , an easy-to-use, block-based, 80's retro-style pixelated game maker by [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/). Here are some games I made _(plz note that the names arent so good)_:

*   [Dark Phantom Shadowflight](https://arcade.makecode.com/S50268-70249-95385-93401)
*   [Super Speed Gotham City](https://arcade.makecode.com/S46516-73490-36974-12240)
*   [Firemasters 2](https://arcade.makecode.com/S50835-10296-39185-23191)
