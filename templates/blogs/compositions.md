Ishaant's compositions
======================

I am a budding Music **_Maestro_**, with _gasps, cue in the dramatic music_ 
**4 years of Guitar experience and 5 years of Drum experience**. I learn drums at [Euphony CPA](https://www.euphony.in/) from the [_Trinity Rock&Pop syllabus_](https://www.trinityrock.com/instruments/drums), I'm currently in Grade 4. I've been learning guitar from a private tutor; 
first JUST chords, then [Classical guitar](https://www.trinitycollege.com/qualifications/music/grade-exams). 
I haven't taken any guitar exams. Since I knew classical guitar and staff notation, I thought 
_Why not compose some pieces?_ So here are my pieces on [SoundSlice](https://www.soundslice.com). You can view my SoundSlice account from [here](https://www.soundslice.com/users/Ishaant/).
