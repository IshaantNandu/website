# About Ishaant Nandu
***
### General

I'm Ishaant Nandu-a literature and science lover. I'm and go to [Avalon Heights International School](https://www.avalonheights.org/) in Mumbai, India. I **love reading books**. From reading PokÃ¨mon, to classic novellas like [Alex Rider](https://alexrider.com/), All of [Rick Riordan's books](https://rickriordan.com/), (Kudos to many other authors who's names aren't mentioned.), my motto slowly changed from **Gotta Catch 'Em All** to **Gotta Read 'Em All**. I've been learning acoustic Guitar for **Almost 5** years from a online tutor, **and** drums for about **Almost 6** from [Euphony CPA](https://www.euphony.in/). I love [Lego](https://lego.com) although I don't get much time to play with them now ðŸ˜­.PS: don't call it 'legos' because it disrespects the company and doesn't refer to EXACTLY what you want to say: like lego bricks, lego sets, lego models. Bye, I'll see you in my blogs.
