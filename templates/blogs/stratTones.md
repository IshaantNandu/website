# Cool clean Strat tones

## Abstract
If you have a Fender HSS Stratocaster like me, but don't have any distortion pedals and want a unique sound, then this guide's for you! I'm using a [*Fender*&trade; *Squier* &trade; *Sonic* HSS *Stratocaster*&trade;](https://intl.fender.com/products/squier-sonic-stratocaster-hss), but any HSS Stratocaster will do. We're gonna use clean settings, which means you have to switch off all the **distortion**, **overdrive/drive**, and **fuzz** pedals and settings on amp. A little bit of *echo* and *reverb* can add a nice effect to the tones along with some *chorus* filters if possible. So let's dive in!
***

## Prerequisites
You will need-

- Any [HSS Stratocaster](https://intl.fender.com/search?q=hss%20stratocaster)
- A guitar Amplifier, most preferably by <br> [Fender](https://intl.fender.com/collections/contemporary-digital-guitar-amplifiers), [BlackStar](https://blackstaramps.com/guitar-amps-launch-page/), [Gibson](https://www.gibson.com/en-US/Amps) or [Orange](https://orangeamps.com)
- _Optional_- *Reverb*, *Echo* or *Chorus* pedals

### Let's Dive in!

The controls we're using are the 
- The pickup selector- <br>
  ![Pickup Selector](../../static/images/pickupSelector.png){: .hello}
- The tone knobs- people usually say '*Put the knobs at 2'o clock*' which means to put the knob's mark or *1* marking like the hour hand of that position based on how big is the range of it's rotation.

1. ### Dreamy Sound
   An amazing sound, very *dreamy* and good for hiphop-jazz music.
   Goes well with *chorus*, *echo* and *reverb*. Sounds best with _Major-7^th^_, and _Minor-7^th^_ chords.d
   > Set the pickup selector to the position between **Center** and **Neck** pickups. Set both the *tone* knobs to *1'o clock* or *1*.
2. ### Bluesy Bond
   Bluesy sound, with high treble.
   Goes well with Hum-bucker pickups, overdrive and slight reverb.
   > Set the pickup selector to the **Bridge** pickup and set both the *tone* knobs to *10'o clock* or *10*.
